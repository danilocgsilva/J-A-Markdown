# J-A-Markdown

Just another markdown viewer

It is incredibly difficult to search for a simple Markdown reader:

* Tons of browsers extensions. But with lots of brower stuffs that kill a good user experience. Also, it seams that each extension randomly works in different operational systems.

* Some stand alone offline application? Some, but the also offer (unreliable) writting options, that also mess a simple usage.

* Maybe exists in Windows or Mac ecossystem. But MUST exists available for a Linux user, and work in the same way in Linux and Windows.

So, a need to create one!
